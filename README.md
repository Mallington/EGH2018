# EGH2018
For a hackathon! Engineering gate hackathon.
We were given 2 different challenges we could work on over a period of 24 hours:
1) Charting (displaying) of a collection of fake stock markets, with technical information displayed,
such as moving averages.
2) Forecasting (predicting) the future prices of the same fake stock markets.

We decided to focus only on the first challenge. Below is a Screenshot of our finished product:

A few challenges we came across during development:
- Merging code between the versions we were working on.
  This could have been eliminated by utilising branches
- Some of the mathematics, as none of us had any knowledge in economics or statistics
- The learning curve of picking up python for the first time/after a long time

We ended up finishing in 2nd place for our given challenge,
which was mainly because we were unfortunately unable to add all of the mathematics in time
